 The exponential growth of academic research has increased the demand for effective tools to streamline
 access to relevant conference papers. This project addresses that need by creating a versatile retrieval
 tool designed to accomplish two main tasks: (a) generate a list of accepted papers for specific conferences
 and years, and (b) filter relevant papers from selected conferences based on a query sentence. 


To run this project follow the following steps :

1. Open command prompt
2. Type the command 'python -m streamlit run interface.py' or simply 'streamlit run interface.py'
3. A web interface will open in front of you 
4. Select the conference , year and enter your query.
5. Press the submit button
6. Top 5 research papers corresponding to that year and confernce will be displayed in increasing order of relevance with 
   respect to the query ( i.e. first one being the most relevant and last one being the least relevant with respect to the query).
